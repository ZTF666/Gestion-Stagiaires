# Gestion Stagiaires / Internships Manager

An old simple webapp i made couple of years ago .
The app was made during an internship and was my first real php oop project.
it keeps track of other interns and supervisors .
mark the interns by the sups.
assign subjects to interns .
list all concluded internships.
list all active internships.
and many more .

Excuse the lack of organisation , i had none back at that time 😆 .
The text is in french as it was required but the code and few comments are all in english .
